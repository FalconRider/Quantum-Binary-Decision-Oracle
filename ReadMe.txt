The ORACLE Api - DECISION SUPPORT PROOF APP
Your a manager and yYou need to make a decision between 2 alternatives
 and there could pressure to prove you made a truely 
 random and independant decision.
Big stakes and probable legal challenges if theres any doubt you influenced the decision
------------------------------------------------
Like a  doctor with 2 Covid Patients. A rich one and a poor one, equally critical
and he has 1 repirator. and the press is watching.
------------------------------------------------
Or current US Presidential race, both parties have agree to a coin toss win.
that you're supposed to run. Who's coin, who flips. How can it not be influenced?
-----------------------------------------------

Or  which branch office gets the next surprise audit. 
Or chosing between two aquisitions, one US the other in China, maybe a distant relative
owns shares in one of them.  Yon need CYA.
--------------------------


So here is a trustless COIN TOSS equivalent SAAS idea with the True Randomness of a QUANTUM
superposition state,  made independantly and you get  PROOF that this is how you made your decision.
And that proof can be independanly verified by crytpgraphic means. 
( marketing will love this stuff).

Howz it work.
You enter a descriptive Title of your quandy 
You enter a recognizable name for each  of your TWO choices.
This is a binary machine, for larger alternative groups split in half and repeat working down to two named chices.
Sort of a binary sort in reverse  ; )

 ie CHOICE 1 -Trump CHOICE 2 Bidden
 A time stamp is produced and returned.
Based on the UNIX time of the processing computer to a fraction of a second. 
This is the unique identifier for this decision, just in case sokmeone want to keep running until
they get the answer they want.

 You hit the Green Arrow.
 You get back - -
 A certificate with your decision made for you.
with the choices stated.
 the initial entry request timestamp 

AND a cryptograhic hash of all that that could only be generated
from the sum of the same information. - including that timestamp.

A second program is  a verifyer that lets you, enter the choices, winner and timestamp
and independantly gives you the same hash to verify the decision certificate is authentic.

You'd need witnessed decisions with logging of the decision, timestamp and hash  perhaps on a public blockchain.
You could easily enter this in an Ethereum transaction as text in the data field (might have to hex it) to  make the criteria immuable and  
publically avaiable on Etherscan or any of the other chain viewers.  Cost a little gas but you get CYA!
